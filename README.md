Poster for presentation in Statistical Analysis of Incomplete Data

Tree-based and pmm-based Multiple Imputation methods:
Flexible approaches such as Predictive Mean Matching (Rubin 1986, Little
1988) and tree-based methods (Burgette & Reiter 2010) help to overcome
some of the problems of purely model-based MI if the data generating
process is obscure.
Objectives:
(a) Compare tree-based methods from the miceranger package with tree-
based methods in mice. Conduct a simulation study with empirical
data sets and variable numbers ranging from 10 to app. 50, where
these methods are compared.
